========

**Tomocupy_stream** is a Python package and a command-line interface for GPU reconstruction of tomographic/laminographic data in 16-bit and 32-bit precision. All preprocessing operations are implemented on GPU with using CuPy library, the backprojection operation is implemented with CUDA C.

Tomocupy_stream implements an efficient data processing conveyor allowing to overlap all data transfers with computations. First, independent Python threads are started for reading data chunks from the hard disk into a Python data queue and for writing reconstructed chunks from the Python queue to the hard disk. Second, CPU-GPU data transfers are overlapped with GPU computations by using CUDA streams. 

**Note:** For the best performance it is recommended to use fast data storage otherwise most of reconstruction time will be spent for rw operations. PCIe NVME SSDs (e.g., Samsung 970/980 EVO/PRO) allows for parallel data read/write operations and with tomocupy_stream works 4-8 times faster than regular HDD.
